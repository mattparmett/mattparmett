Hi, I'm Matt.  I'm a software engineer based in Seattle who loves working on back-end systems.

I recently launched my software engineering career by completing [@upenn](https://github.com/upenn)'s Master of Computer and Information Technology program.  While in school, I interned [@LibertyMutual](https://github.com/libertymutual) and [Kanary](https://www.linkedin.com/company/thekanary/).  Before that, I invested in innovative healthcare startups at Echo Health Ventures and worked with large hospital systems as an investment banker at J.P. Morgan.

Some things I've been hacking on:
- Learning about programming languages by building an interpreter ([Crafting Interpreters](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters) by [@munificent](https://github.com/munificent))
- Learning how `git` works by building a `git` implementation ([Building Git](https://shop.jcoglan.com/building-git/) by [@jcoglan](https://github.com/jcoglan))
